# Material Dock

You can obtain materials for your project from [Material Maker](https://github.com/RodZill4/material-maker). Make sure to export to godot and import the resulting files into your project.

The material dock provides a place to view and apply materials to your environment.

Add materials to the material dock by clicking and dragging .tres files from the file system dock.
